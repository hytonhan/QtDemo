# QtDemo

A small c++/Qt project

## Overview

This project is a **C++ / Qt desktop application** built to demonstrate my skills as an aspiring C++ developer.  
The focus of the project is **clean architecture, separation of concerns, and modern C++/Qt practices**, rather than UI complexity.

The application manages domain entities such as students, teachers, and study programs, using a layered architecture backed by an SQL database.

## Goals of the Project

This project was created to demonstrate:

- Practical use of **C++ with Qt (Widgets)**
- Clean **layered architecture** in a non-trivial application
- Separation of **domain logic**, **infrastructure**, and **UI**
- Use of **Qt Model/View architecture**
- Database interaction via **repositories**
- Testable design (unit tests added using Qt Test)

## Technologies Used

- **C++ (C++17)**
- **Qt 6**
  - Qt Widgets
  - Qt SQL
- **SQLite**
- **CMake**

## Architecture Overview

The application follows a **layered architecture** inspired by clean architecture principles.
